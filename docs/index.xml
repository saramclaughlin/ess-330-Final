      <title>Sea Level rise has had significant impacts on water quality. As
  the sea level increases, saltwater intrusion can contaminate
  freshwater aquifers which reduce the availability of clean drinking
  water
  (<xref alt="Werner &amp; Simmons, 2009" rid="ref-werner2009" ref-type="bibr">Werner
  &amp; Simmons, 2009</xref>). The intrusion of saltwater also degrades
  wetlands, which act as a natural water filter and are habitats for
  diverse aquatic species. The decrease in wetlands diminishes their
  ability to buffer against storm surges and filter pollutants, further
  compromising the water quality
  (<xref alt="Dessu et al., 2018" rid="ref-dessu2018" ref-type="bibr">Dessu
  et al., 2018</xref>). Also, rising sea levels lead to more frequent
  and severe coastal flooding which can result in an overflow of sewage
  systems and carry pollutants into waterways. This increase in
  contamination can endanger public health and harm aquatic ecosystems.
  Understanding and addressing the effects of sea level rise on water
  quality is significant for protecting freshwater resources, preserving
  ecosystems and ensuring the sustainability of coastal communities. Our
  hypothesis to address this research project is: If sea level rise has
  increased from 2010 to 2024 in the state of Florida, then the salinity
  levels in freshwater sources will also have increased, degrading
  overall freshwater quality. This will require two data sets: (1) sea
  level data from NOAA’s Tides and Current database and (2) freshwater
  quality (specifically, salinity) data from the USGS National Water
  Information System. From this data, we will construct a spearman
  correlation test to determine correlation, a linear regression model
  to determine the strength of the relationship, and a scatter plot to
  visualize the relationship.</title>

      <title>The data used in this project cover 2 environmental variables
  that were measured between 2010 and 2024 across Florida. The data we
  are using for this project come from 2 main sources: the salinity
  measurements from USGS and the sea level trends from NOAA. The first
  comes from water quality data available in the USGS website for
  salinity of water between 2010 and 2024 from three different gauges
  near Virginia Key, Pensacola, and Panama City Beach. The salinity data
  were downloaded from the USGS database. The sea level data comes from
  NOAA, specifically from the Virginia Key, Pensacola, and Panama City
  Beach stations. The first variable is sea level (in meters), which
  shows the trend in sea level rise throughout the years. The second is
  salinity (ppth), which shows fluctuations of salinity of the area in
  this timeframe. Salinity data are presented in the form of a time
  series that varies over time, while the data on sea level show an
  increasing trend. Sites and gauges were selected based on the nearest
  distance in km. Three gauges from the USGS water quality data set were
  selected to be paired with the Virginia Key, Pensacola, and Panama
  City Beach sites from the NOAA sea level rise data set. We will need
  to clean the sea level rise data by altering the format of the CSV
  (code given by Prof. Johnson) and merging all three sites’ datasets
  together. We will need to clean the USGS water quality data set by
  selecting for only the three specified locations and only the
  variables we need (such as salinity, date, latitude, longitude, and
  site ID).</title>

      <title>We will be using a spearman correlation test, linear regression
  model, and ggplot to analyze our data to answer our research question.
  I think we do have everything we need for this: sea level rise data
  (2010-2024 for 18 sites in Florida), water quality (salinity) data
  (2010-2024 for all gauges in Florida). Latitude and longitudes were
  included for each point of the water quality data. We do need
  supplemental latitude and longitude data for the sea level rise points
  to match them with water quality data, but I was able to collect this
  from NOAA and record them in an excel sheet. I think the most
  challenging part of this process will be selecting which sites to use
  from the two data sets, as we will need to determine which three sites
  align most closely by location between the sets of data. The way their
  lat and longitudes were recorded are not identical, and the location
  data for sea level rise was recorded separately from the actual sea
  level data which makes this more difficult. I think some potential
  challenges in the analysis portion of the project that may arise are
  avoiding other confounding variables as hydrological conditions vary
  greatly across sites. Also, since this is an observational study, our
  analysis will only be able to determine correlation instead of
  causation, which limits the meaning of our results. Our selected
  tests, however, will be useful in determining our final results. The
  spearman’s correlation test will first determine if there is a
  correlation between the two variables (sea level rise and salinity).
  Once we’ve determined a correlation, the linear regression model will
  allow us to test the strength of this correlation to determine
  significance. Finally, employing a scatter plot will be useful for
  easier visualization of this relationship to confirm our
  results.</title>
